Together, the three of us relished the air conditioning and planted ourselves on the soft sofa. We were then in prime movie-watching position.

The film: Idiocracy (2006). Directed by Mike Judge and starring Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph, Idiocracy lambasts insatiable consumerism, mindless hedonism, and demagoguery; the film predicts these factors halving the median IQ by 2505, catering to people\u2019s basest impulses, and producing a society of dopamine-addicted cretins who do little but watch porn and masturbate.
 
Idiocracy is not subtle, but it is often funny. Some of the dialogue is so funny as to instantly broadcast that the movie was made in the aughts\u2014certainly not past 2014. Hilarious though it may be, the economic premises of the film are flawed; it\u2019s political conclusions objectionable.

In the film, America spirals into its 2505 hellscape due to a lack of \u201Cmoral restraint\u201D on behalf of the stupidest and an overabundance thereof on behalf of the smartest. Malthusianism is uniformly tiresome and this instance is no exception. This plot device is especially unpersuasive when one surveys the fertility rates of developed nations around the globe: They\u2019re at or below replacement levels. The not-so-subtle undertones of eugenics and social Darwinism add insult to injury.
 
If the premise of the film is flawed and morally dubious (it is), its conclusion is doubly so. In the end, the idiocracy is replaced with an epistocracy in which the smartest man on earth runs the economy\u2014and everything else\u2014by fiat. Technocratic tyranny is a poor substitute for liberal democracy in the short term and absolutely ruinous in the long run, particularly if one values an educated, responsible, and autonomous citizenry.
 
To test its top-secret Human Hibernation Project, the Pentagon picks the most average Americans it can find - an Army private and a prostitute - and sends them to the year 2505 after a series of freak events. But when they arrive, they find a civilization so dumbed-down that they're the smartest people around.
