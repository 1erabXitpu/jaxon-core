Originally limited to the upper classes and meant to align clans via shared bloodlines, modern-day omiai services are typically approached by the person looking to marry. They are not an arranged marriage per se, but a personally catered selection of suitable partners that said person can meet, get to know and then decide to date/marry.

If you are looking for a serious relationship where marriage is the goal, then in terms of apps you need to be careful. A true omiai type dating app is rare. The vast majority of omiai services are still conducted in person (or via video chat), as for relationships of this type you need a deeply personal touch rather than an algorithm. Two of the top non-app services are En-Konkatsu Agent and IBJ.
 
There are also several factors to keep in mind with any match-making service. First, you will need to have excellent Japanese language skills. The vast majority of these services are Japanese only. Next, your age. The majority of apps are used by those in their 20s-30s and older users may have little luck finding a partner this way.
 
You will also need to be living in Japan (some may require a copy of your Residence card and/or passport), and for some especially strict services, provide proof of your annual income and ability to support yourself in Japan outside of getting married.
 
Better still, look for a young heiress in a chaebol family and marry her.................This has happened before, a young woman from a family like this fell in love with her uneducated, moronic, body guard and married him, however, after years of verbal and physical abuse from him she kicked him out. But sadly he got 5 million yen for his trouble.

**Marriage** and **dating** have changed little in the western world for a long time. Yet changes in attitude, shifting values and beliefs, have led to profound impacts on dating and marriage. More and more people are finding it difficult to **find a marriage partner**, someone who wants to commit to spending their life with their partner.
 
Japan is famous for politeness and kindness, people in general are very good to each other, and it is one of the safest places in the world. Much of this is due to a very long running honor system and people wishing to do the right thing. There is also a challenge with this that very few people will interact with strangers, beyond a surface level of politeness, due to lack of trust.
 
When the **Omiai matchmaking** system was first used in the 16th century it was used to match sons and daughters of samurai houses, so that alliances could be forged strong. At that time many in Japan looked up to the samurai, and wished to mimic them as best they could. As a result, Omiai matchmaking spread throughout other classes in Japan, as people thought it would be a good way to arrange marriage for their children.
 
Over time the practice waned, and people sought more to find someone who was a love match for marriage. Over time challenge with this has increased with population migration, and issues around trust of strangers increased. While in many countries exchanging details after a brief meeting is common for those interested in dating, it is exceptionally rare in Japan. Unless people have common friends or acquaintances, then even pleasant chance encounters are likely to remain happy memories rather than built into relationships.
 
As a result **marriage agencies** in Japan have revived the **Omiai matchmaking system** in the last 20 or so years, adapting it and shifting the focus to finding the best marriage matching for lost term happy marriage. Something which has seen use of **Japanese marriage agencies** grow during that time.
 
**Omiai marriage matching** through Japanese marriage agencies has helped people in Japan to **overcome dating challenges**, lack of confidence in their ability to find a good loving partner, and so much more.
 
From talking with various clients, helping them with relationship issues during sessions, clear patterns are discernable with dating in western countries. Many are now so focused on freedom, having and doing what they want, when they want, or just wanting casual relationships. Causing real issue for those who do actually wish to find a marriage partner and enjoy life long happy marriage committed to their partner.
 
As a result that gap is now being filled by **marriage agencies** which can find a marriage partner that matches well. With the history that exists with Omiai matchmaking in Japan, there are companies like **Marriage Matching** based in Osaka, with multilingual staff who are now expanding across the seas to help people in **the US**, and many other countries to find that special someone, who they can truly enjoy a life long happy marriage with.
 
**Finding a life partner** can be really challenging. Especially for those of us that are seeking something different to what is in our surrounding environment. When you think of the complexities of character, values, beliefs and how psychologically diverse people are, it becomes understandable why many struggle to find a marriage partner.
 
With job searches many have come to see real value in using agencies and head hunters. When looking for a home we entrust the search to agencies who know what we want. Naturally some agencies are better than others, and we always hope we have a great agency helping us find what we seek. When searching for information we use search engines to help us narrow down results and present suitable options.
 
For anyone who has struggled to **find a marriage partner**, or a **life partner**, that they really click with. Who resonates with them in a way that has them confident that a life long happy marriage, or a life long happy partnership, is possible. Then having help to find a marriage partner, or life partner, does have real value.

Tachiko was a lively young woman of about thirty. She was bright and funny, neither plain nor pretty, and a brilliant piano player. The first time I met Tachiko, she told me about her omiai habit. "I've been on about thirty-five omiai," she said matter-of-factly. "Omiai are my hobby."
 
I was new in Japan at the time and intrigued by the whole concept. What was an omiai like? Tachiko pondered this. "It's really just a first date, I guess. Sometimes it's formal and your parents will go with you, but most of the time it's informal and you just go and meet the guy on your own. At a coffee house or a restaurant, say. And you talk. You know, about the kinds of things you usually talk about on a first date. Hobbies, stuff you liked in school--things like that."
 
For Tachiko, it was a point of pride that after the omiai, she would invariably have her mother call up the next day and offer her regrets. She would do this even when she liked the guy and felt that they'd hit it off. I couldn't understand this and I said so. Tachiko shrugged. "I'm not much of a catch: my parents aren't rich, I'm not beautiful, I didn't go to a good university. I figure the guys will probably say no themselves; I just beat them to it by saying it first." I thought this sounded defeatist, but Tachiko maintained that this way she got to go on a lot of dates and go out with a lot of boys she would otherwise never have the chance to meet. Why bother to go on omiai at all, I wondered, but I did not say this to her.
 
The last time I talked to Tachiko, she'd just had her forty-fourth omiai and seemed remarkably blas� about the whole thing. "The last guy was really cute," she sighed. "And he liked books, too." "Weren't you tempted not to turn him down?" She shook her head. "I figure if one of them really likes me, he'll call back." She shrugged. "Anyway, we always make them a pound cake. I'm really good at making pound cakes."
 
Junko was forty-two and divorced. She had been married briefly to a widower with two teenaged children after her colleagues had arranged an omiai. An attractive, maternally inclined woman, Junko had been looking forward to mothering her new husband's teenagers. She'd had no idea what she was getting into. "They hated me from the word go. Nothing I cooked tasted right to them, nothing I did impressed or pleased them. They hated the new curtains I bought, hated the color I painted the bathroom, hated the drapes I hung, the sweaters I knitted for them. In fact, they really hated me, and it didn't take them long to persuade their father I was no good. I felt like Cinderella. I cooked for them, cleaned their rooms, drove them to piano lessons and parties--and they still hated me."
 
Once, on hearing that I had been proposed to by a man I had no intention of marrying, Junko urged me to accept. "Go on--say yes! Just give it a try! If you don't, you'll never know whether you like being married or not!" She sighed. "I wish someone would arrange another omiai for me..." Junko worked full-time as an accountant, but she still managed to get through fifteen Harlequin Romances a week. She had entire bin bags full of them in her closet.
 
Keiko was twenty-five. She was beautiful, but intimidatingly intelligent. And tall. "On my first omiai, the guy asked me how tall I was," she said, disgusted. "And when I told him, he looked really depressed. He goes: You're t
