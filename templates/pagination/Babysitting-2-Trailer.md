My main concern about becoming a driver, is that it seems to be a inescapable fact of life that drivers often are stuck for several hours or even a few days waiting to be loaded/unloaded or being assigned the next new load. Down time that you may or may not be getting any pay for.

Yes, you can leave the truck. There are some situations where you know that you won't be needed so you a free to do as you please. The reality is that most of the places where the truck will fit don't have a lot of things to do within walking distance. Honestly, the few times I've had to sit I didn't really mind that much. Catch up on sleep, relax, clean the cab.
 
Don't mean to threadjack, but I have a related question: does anyone drop their trailer and bobtail to walmart or wherever? I knnow some people do it, but I know a lot of the truck stops don't allow dropping trailers, and I don't know if the big companies allow you to do it. I haven't asked at my company, but I get the idea that it's kind of a grey area where they don't forbid it but don't want to encourage it either. We were issued kingpin locks, so they must be expecting it to happen sometimes.
 
I've also taken the full rig to Walmart. You always want to verify with the Walmart that this is ok to do! Trucker Path app shows walmarts and you can get a good idea of which ones allow to park, either to shop or overnight
 
With my company, I am NOT allowed to drop a loaded trailer. I have a secure facility to park the truck when I go home with 24 hour security plus a kingpin lock. And I still can't drop a loaded trailer. Empty is no big deal.
 
I drop my truck (with trailer) at a Flying J near my house for 34 hour resets all the time. Locked, front curtains closed. Also, tat another location, there's a movie theater near a side street I can park on. When I'm in the area and waiting for a load, I can watch Iron Man 6.
 
Kurt, that's a related question and not threadjacking. You may be tempted, and see the dropped trailers at truck stops, but for most major carriers, dropping a trailer w/o orders is a big no-no. Even if you have that kingpin lock handy.

Hey Mac, you got some good responses, and I am like Deb - I will sometimes rent an inexpensive car if I am somewhere interesting and going to be there for a while. Often times I will just tell my Driver Manager to plan on letting me do a 34 hour reset when I am delivering somewhere interesting like this week when I ended up emptying out down in Boca Raton, Florida.
 
One thing I want to point out though, and forgive my probing. Just from the premise of your question and some of the phrases you used it sounds like you have been reading a lot of the negative company bashing stuff about trucking on the internet. Be very careful at taking in some of the nonsense you read online about these evil trucking companies and how they treat their drivers. It's all hogwash! Yes there is waiting involved in trucking, but it has nothing to do with your trucking company, but rather it is a part of the job, and if anyone is at fault it would be the shippers and receivers. Personally, I sit and wait very little. Like I said I will ask my dispatcher to let me take a 34 occasionally, and when I do I will get a response something like this: "anything you need my man. just let me know when you are ready to roll again!"
 
These trucking companies make money by keeping you busy, they do not hire you to "babysit" their equipment, they hire you to move freight. Everything about trucking is performance based, that is why the drivers get paid by the mile. The really good drivers who manage their time and deliveries properly are assigned the best loads and are not hung out to dry just for the company's jollies. I have to laugh sometimes when I hear some of the stories that are put online about truck drivers claiming they should be getting paid for being a security guard for the truck they were assigned! I have never sat so long waiting around for a load, in fact 95% of the time I have a load already planned out for me before I'm finished with my current one. Don't start getting yourself all worked up as to how you are going to spend the time that you are sitting, rather prepare yourself ahead of time by considering how you are going to be that top performer that they know will be out there "git'n er done!" That will solve your dilemma of being a babysitter.
 
"Is a company driver allowed to lock up and leave his truck parked somewhere unattended in order to participate in personal recreational activities when he knows he will not be driving for a significant amount of time?"
 
Which is great news to me, as my primary motivation to possibly take up truck driving is for the opportunity to travel the country. But I wanted to confirm that I would be able to slip away from the truck every now and then, for some local exploring during an extended down time.

Should be compulsory for other daycare places too.

Even though the David Gordon Green comedy The Sitter was basically a raunchy, darker version of **Adventures in Babysitting**, the family comedy favorite from 1987 is getting a more official remake by way of The Disney Channel. This time instead of one babysitter played by **Elisabeth Shue** forced to take some kids out for a night in the scary city of Chicago in order to save a stranded friend, there are two babysitters with a different problem.
 
This time Disney Channel has two of their own stars, **Sabrina Carpenter** of Girl Meets World and **Sofia Carson** of The Descendants, leading the movie as two babysitters who have lost one of the kids they're supposed to be watching. The first Adventures in Babysitting trailer has just arrived, and it's about what you would expect from Disney Channel, for better or worse.
 
If it's been awhile, you may not notice that there are some clear homages to the original movie. From that shot of Sofia Carson sitting on the couch when the parents come home to Sabrina Carpenter's coat being rather similar to the same one that Elisabeth Shue wore in the original. There's also the much more tame version of the line "Don't f\*\*\* with the babysitter." And it's cool to see that they figured out a way to reference the blues club scene from the first movie, but updated it with a rap battle between the two babysitters. Like I said, it's exactly what you would expect from Disney Channel.
 
There's plenty of changes to be found as well with four kids (**Nikki Hahn**, **Mallory James Mahoney**, **Madison Horcher** and **Jet** **Jurgensmeyer**) instead of three this time, all with different personalities and quirks. Plus who knows what's up with that supposedly rare ferret. In addition, the bad guys in pursuit of the babysitters and the kids do seem to be a little more tame and silly, in Home Alone fashion, than the dangerous criminals **Chris Columbus** had in his movie.
 
In Adventures in Babysitting, a dull evening for two competing babysitters, Jenny (Sabrina Carpenter) and Lola (Sofia Carson), turns into an adventure in the big city as they hunt for one of the kids who somehow snuck away. Written by Tiffany Paulsen ("Nancy Drew), it will be directed by John Schultz (Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer, Like Mike) and executive-produced by Michelle Manning (Teen Beach 2, The Breakfast Club).
 
Does it soften the blow when a remake of your favorite 80s movie is rebooted for the small screen? Or does it make it worse? The 1987 comedy classic **Adventures In Babysitting** has been revamped for a whole new generation. But you don't need to head to the local cinemaplex to see it. This all-new version of **Adventures in Babysitting** will make its debut on Disney Channel this summer!
 
How much trouble can two babysitters get in during one night? Find out during the newest Disney Channel Original movie, **Adventures in Babysitting**, starring Sabrina Carpenter from Girl Meets World and Sofia Carson. Much like the original, a suburban babysitter must leave her safe surroundings and head for the heart of the big city to rescue a stranded friend, unaware of the perilous adventures that await her and the kids she's looking after who have tagged along.
 
An Adventures In Babysitting remake has long been in the planning stages, and was originally supposed to happen in 2012 with Raven-Symon&#233. The actress dropped out of the project shortly thereafter. For a short time, it looked like Miley Cyrus would step in and take over the lead. But that never happened. Now, we get the remake, but it's being tailored for Disney Chann
