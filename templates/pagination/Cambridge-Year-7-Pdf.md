The Five Year Plan allows for coordinating utility companies to plan their work ahead of street and sidewalk reconstruction, significantly reducing the need for repeated opening of the street or sidewalk. The plan is reviewed on an annual basis, however it is subject to revisions based on uncertainties like:
 
Email Kristen Kelleher, Community Relations Manager, at kkelleher@cambridgema.gov. The plan is updated annually based on the priorities indicated above, but resource constraints limit the number of areas that can be reconstructed in a year. Your request will be submitted to the engineering department for review. To report a pothole or a sidewalk defect, please use the Commonwealth Connect reporting system.
 
Cambridge's famous Colleges and University buildings attract visitors from all over the world, while its museums and collections also hold many treasures which give an exciting insight into the scholarly activities of the University's academics and students.
 
The University's reputation for outstanding academic achievement is known worldwide and reflects the intellectual achievement of its students over more than eight centuries, as well as the world-class original research carried out by the staff of the University and the Colleges. Many of the University's customs and unusual terminology can be traced to roots in the early years of the University's long history, and this section of our website looks to the past to find the origins of much that is distinctive in the University of today.

Development begins at North West Cambridge.
The Institute of Continuing Education celebrates its 140th anniversary.
The Cambridge Centre for Advanced Research and Education in Singapore (Cambridge CARES) is established as The University's first research centre outside of the UK.
 
**The Foundation Year in Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences is a stepping stone to study at Cambridge. If you've experienced educational disadvantages, this free course will prepare you to study at university.**

 
The programme offers a challenging academic curriculum. It will broaden and deepen your knowledge and understanding of the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. You'll get to experience Cambridge's teaching methods and educational community.
 
You will be taught through lectures, seminars and supervisions. This will develop your ability to take philosophical, reflective and critical approaches to different sources. You'll also learn to use a range of analytical methods.
 
Secondly, you will be encouraged to develop your language skills if you already have a solid grounding in another language. For example, you studied a language at A level. Experience of formal language-learning is essential for some degree courses. This stream can help you to gain that experience.

All international/overseas fee status students, and those Home fee status students who aren't eligible for tuition fee support (eg affiliated students), normally have to pay an annual College fee in addition to University tuition fees. This covers the cost to your College of providing a range of educational, domestic and pastoral services and support.
 
College fees may vary between Colleges and in many cases are fixed for the duration of your course. College fees for 2024-25 are published in the following document: Undergraduate tuition fees 2024-25.
 
Your living expenses may be higher than for a UK student, for example if you stay in Cambridge/the UK during vacations. In 2024-25, the minimum resources needed in Cambridge for a full 12 months (excluding tuition and College fees) are estimated to be approximately 14,600, depending on lifestyle. We've rounded this figure up to the nearest 10. You should be aware that because maintenance rates are set more than a year in advance based on inflation rates at the time, the cost of living may have risen before you arrive in Cambridge.
 
These costs were calculated in May 2023 according to the Bank of England inflation forecast at that time. They are intended to be indicative and were reviewed in November 2023 following the original calculation. Updated figures will be available from September 2024. New students should also allow for settling-in costs, including visas, travel and equipment. Further guidance is available on the International Student Office website.
 
Please note that all students are ordinarily expected to live and study in Cambridge during term time for the full duration of their course (with the exception of the year abroad where part of the course).
 
The structure of Part III is such that students prepare between six and nine lecture courses for examination. These lecture courses may be freely selected from the wide range offered by both Mathematics Departments. As an alternative to one lecture course, an essay may be submitted. Examinations usually begin in late May, and are scheduled in morning and afternoon sessions, over a period of about two weeks. Two or three hours are allocated per paper, depending on the subject.
 
Part III is a 9 month taught masters course in mathematics. It is an excellent preparation for mathematical research and it is also a valuable course in mathematics and in its applications for those who want further training before taking posts in industry, teaching, or research establishments.
 
Students admitted from outside Cambridge to Part III study towards the Master of Advanced Study (MASt). Students continuing from the Cambridge Tripos for a fourth year, study towards the Master of Mathematics (MMath). The requirements and course structure for Part III are the same for all students irrespective of whether they are studying for the MASt or MMath degree.
 
There are over 250 Part III (MASt and MMath) students each year; almost all are in their fourth or fifth year of university studies. There are normally about 75 courses, covering an extensive range of pure mathematics, probability, statistics, applied mathematics and theoretical physics. They are designed to cover those advanced parts of the subjects that are not normally covered in a first-degree course, but which are an indispensable preliminary to independent study and research. Students have a wide choice of the combination of courses that they offer, though naturally they tend to select groups of cognate courses. Example classes and associated marking of (unassessed) example sheets are provided as complementary support to lectures.
 
As a taught masters course, the main emphasis is on lecture courses, and assessment is almost entirely based on exams, which are taken at the end of the academic year starting in the last week of May. The standard graduation dates for successful candidates are in June and July.
 
The University values diversity and is committed to equality of opportunity. The Faculty would particularly welcome applications from women, since women are, and have historically been, underrepresented in our student cohorts.
 
The **University of Cambridge** is a public collegiate research university in Cambridge, England. Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[8][9] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.
 
In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter, granted by King Henry III. The University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. The largest department is Cambridge University Press & Assessment, which has 1 billion of annual revenue and reaches 100 million learners.[10] All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.[11][12]
 
The university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116
