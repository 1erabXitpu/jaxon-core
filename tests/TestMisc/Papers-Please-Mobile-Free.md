AAEA seeks submissions for Selected Presentations for the 2018 AAEA Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. Selected Presentations are a submission category that represents both Selected Papers and Selected Posters. All submissions are reviewed and accepted together, and only after acceptance are the submissions designated as a paper or poster. At the time of submission, individuals will have the option for their submission to be considered as a poster only. There is no paper only option.
 
Submissions for Selected Presentations must include a two-page, single-spaced abstract that provides a clear explanation of what will be presented at the Annual Meeting. Authors should include in this abstract a discussion of the relevance of the topic, research methodology, and potential for generating discussion during the meeting. Please do not include your name or contact information in the abstract file.
 
All submissions will be subjected to a common, double-blind review process. After the review process has been completed, topic leaders will construct coherent Selected Paper Sessions and Lightning Sessions based on a common topic. All remaining accepted presentations will be assigned as a poster. Presentation proposal acceptance notifications will be sent via email in March. Emails may be received in spam folders. Should you not find an email by mid-April, please feel free to contact the AAEA Business Office at info@aaea.org or at (414) 918-3190.
 
Poster authors should be available during their assigned interval during the meeting for questions and discussion. The event program and mobile app will list the poster titles, authors, locations, and presentation time. Poster presenters must submit a PDF version of their poster to the AAEA submission site by May 23, 2018. Please keep submissions under 4 MB. AAEA will upload these posters to the AgEcon Search. Posters that miss this deadline will be withdrawn from the program.
 
Up to 8 papers are included in a 90-minute Lightning Session, and up to 4 papers are included in a 90-minute Selected Paper Session. Therefore, each paper presentation in a Lightning Session is allotted 9 minutes, with 7 minutes to present and 2 minutes for discussion. Likewise, each presentation in a Selected Paper Session is allotted 20 minutes, with 15 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for discussion.
 
Authors of Selected Papers must submit a full version of their paper to the AAEA submission site by May 23, 2018. Please keep submissions under 4 MB. AAEA will upload these papers to the AgEcon Search. Papers that miss this deadline will be withdrawn from the program.
