Sanskrit, also spelled संस्कृतम् (saṃskṛtam), is an ancient language of India commonly seen as the grandmother of the Indo-European language family (even English!). Closely allied with Prakrit and Pali, Sanskrit is more exhaustive in both grammar and terms and has the most extensive collection of literature in the world, greatly surpassing its sister-languages Greek and Latin.

The **Saura Purana** (Sanskrit: सौर पुराण, Saura Purāņa) is one of the Shaiva Upapuranas, a genre of Hindu religious texts. The printed editions of this text have 69 chapters (*adhyāya*s). The extant Saura Purana describes itself as a supplement (*khila*) to the Brahma Purana which consisting of two Samhitas with the first being dictated by Sanatkumara and the second by Surya to Vaivasvata Manu.[1][2] It is presumed that an earlier version of this text different from the extant one existed but has since been lost.[1][3]
 
The extant Saura Purana, though proclaimed by Surya, eulogises Shiva and his *shakti* Parvati. This text praises Varanasi and describes its various sacred places and lingas.[4] It consists of a version of the narrative of Urvashi and Pururavas in chapter 31.[1] It also deals with Devi worship, merits of *dāna*s (donations), *vrata*s (vows) and brief descriptions of the Puranas. Chapters 38-40 contain attacks on Madhvacharya, an early medieval philosopher and his works in the form of a prophecy*. [4]*
 
The early printed editions of this text published by the Anandashrama (Anandashrama Sanskrit Series 18), Pune in 1889 and the Vangavasi Press, Calcutta in 1908 (along with a Bengali translation) are practically identical.[4]
 
I heard of an incident in which Suryadev was once killed by Lord Shiva. Can somebody explain to me what is this incident and what Surya's mistake was? And also, please let me know how he became alive again. Please also include the source reference for this story.
 
The story of Shiva (temporarily) killing Surya the sun god is told in the Ganesha Khanda of the Brahma Vaivarta Purana. (See page 349 here.) As I discuss in this answer, one of the most prominent incarnations of Vishnu in ancient times was the sage Narayana, son of Yama god of death and twin brother of the sage Nara. (Nara and Narayana were the prevous births of Arjuna and Krishna.) In any case, in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana's account, the sage Narada asks Narayana about the birth of Ganesha, and then he asks how the remover of obstacles could have suffered such a big obstacle as losing his own head:
 
Narayana responds that it was due to a curse that Shiva had incurred. Once Surya the sun god tried to kill the evil Rakshasas (demons) Mali and Sumali. But these Rakshasas were devotees of Shiva, so Shiva came to their rescue, piercing Surya with his trident and (temporarily) killing him. The Sun immediately went dark, and the sage Kashyapa, Surya's father, was furious. (Kashyapa is the son of Marichi, one of the mind-born sons of Brahma, and Surya is one of the Adityas, the sons of Kashyapa and his wife Aditi.) Shiva restored Surya's life to pacify Kashyapa, but Kashyapa still put a curse on Shiva that he would kill his own son just as he had killed Kashyapa's son:
 
Mali and Sumali were two demons who were devoted to Shiva. The sun-god Surya did not like the demons and was about to kill them. The demons prayed to Shiva and Shiva intervened. He struck Surya with a trident and this made the entire world plunge into darkness. Surya was the sage Kashyapa's son and so, for this act, Kashyapa cursed Shiva. "Just as you pierced my son's chest with a trident, your son's head will be chopped off one day," said Kashyapa.
 
By the way, as I discuss in this answer, the Rakshasa Sumali had a daughter named Kaikeshi, who married the sage Vishravas. Together they had several children, including Ravana, Kumbakarna, and Vibhishana. So it's possible that if Shiva had allowed Surya to kill Sumali, Ravana might never have been born!
 
Suryadev was angry on King Vrisadhvaja (father of Tulas) for ignoring other Gods and only worshiping Shiva and cursed him that he word lose all his wealth and prosperity. When Shiva heard this curse he got angry on Suryadev for cursing his greatest devotee and ran behind him to kill him. On this Suryadev got afraid and along with his father Kasyapa went to Vaikuntha. Due to being afraid and with all the terror their throat started drying out (this is where surya was about to die), they went to the supreme god Narayana and he granted them abhaya (no fear).
 
Some reference said that Once Surya Deva showed he the most powerful Deva in the world. Without Him whole world is priceless. Then His son Shani Deva tried to calm Him and not present Him as great than Lord Shiva. But Surya Deva was so angry that time. Even he stopped his work to give light to the world. Without Surya Light whole world was going to dark space and Asuras are getting powerful. Than Shani put a Rudraksha on the Surya Planet and worshiped to Lord Shiva. Than the Rdraksha give most brighter light than Surya Light. Then Devraj Indra suspended Surya Deva from Divinity and Surya came to a Jangal and He saw two person who worshiped to Lord Shiva. Then Surya tried to kill those two Asuras Mali and Sumali. But they had a boon from Shiva that who would tried to kill them Shiva will totally destroy him. Thats why Shiva killed Surya for attacking to the Asuras. After geting this news to Surya's father Rishi Kashyppo cursed Shiva, Oneday The Trishul will kill Shiva's son.
 
Mali & sumali perfomed penace. Lord shiva was pleased by their penace and appeared before them. Mali and sumali got boon from lord shiva such that whoever attacks them will be killed by lord shiva. Surya dev once went fr rescue of his wife chaya who was attacked by mali and sumali. He attacked mali and sumali in order to rescue chaya. Lord shiva killed surya dev. After that chaya decided to give her life in order to save surya deva. Pleased by devotion of chaya lord shiva gave life to surya dev.
 
The Surya Purana is one of the eighteen Upapuranas, a genre of Hindu religious texts that are considered supplementary to the Mahapuranas. Dedicated to Surya, the sun god, this Purana emphasizes the worship, mythology, and philosophical teachings associated with Surya. The Surya Purana holds a special place in Hinduism for its detailed descriptions of solar worship rituals, cosmology, and moral teachings. It provides a comprehensive guide to the reverence of Surya, illustrating his significance in maintaining cosmic order and bestowing health and prosperity upon his devotees.
 
The Surya Purana is believed to have been composed between the 6th and 11th centuries CE, although exact dates are uncertain. The text is traditionally attributed to the sage Vyasa, who is credited with composing many other Puranas. The period of its composition reflects a time when solar worship was widespread in India, particularly in regions like Odisha, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, where significant Sun temples were constructed. The Surya Purana captures the religious fervor of the time, detailing the rituals, festivals, and philosophical doctrines centered around Surya.
 
The Surya Purana offers profound philosophical teachings that emphasize the importance of Surya as both a personal deity and a universal symbol of light and life. It underscores the significance of solar worship in achieving spiritual enlightenment and material prosperity. The text explores the nature of reality, the self, and the ultimate goal of moksha (liberation), with Surya as the guiding light. Through its myths, rituals, and ethical teachings, the Surya Purana illustrates the transformative power of devotion to Surya and the enduring values of righteousness, knowledge, and devotion.
 
The lineages enumerated and described in the Vishnupurana are primarily of the Kshatriyas. It does not contain lists or descriptions of lineages of Brahamanas or other Varnas. The reason for this omission is perhaps because these other lineages are innumerable, infinite and not useful. Even modern histories primarily deal with royal dynasties.
 
In the present context, the entire human race was created by the Bhagavan. Among this, the class of people who were distinguished to rule over kingdoms was divided as the Solar and Lunar dynasties. When we examine the two, we discover several elements that are interesting and highly useful for researchers. Our purpose is to delineate some notable aspects of eminent royal dynasties.
 
Like Maru of the Solar Dynasty, devāpi, a king of the Lunar Dynasty attains the Yogic State and lives in the same kalāpa village. It is said that he will revive the Lunar Dynasty in the next Yuga cycle.
 
Thus, according to the Vishnupurana, romapāda has an adopted daughter named Shanta, who was the (biological) daughter of Dasharatha. But according to the Harivamsha, Dasharatha who is also known as romapāda has a biological daughter named Shanta. Therefore, there is a mutual c
