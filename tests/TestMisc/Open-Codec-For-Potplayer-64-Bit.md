These include files that have not completed download from say a torrent download.

PotPlayer is a media player software much like**real alternative**and **MPC-HC**. It was developed by South Korean Internet company Kakao. Now it is also available for Windows and can play a wide variety of video and audio formats, including DVD and Blu-ray discs. It also has features such as support for various subtitles, built-in codecs, and support for various skins and plugins. It is a popular player in South Korea and has a large user base worldwide. See also the**HEVC Video Extension** as well. Likewise see **how to use PotPlayer**which is also on here.
 
These internal filters allow it to play a wide variety of media files without the need for additional codecs or software. Additionally, it also support DirectShow filter, and you can use external codecs through it. You can download additional codecs for it below. See also the **xvid codec** for it below. PotPlayer Codec Pack aka OpenCodec (64-bit) is also below. This is also the Potplayer **HEVC**codec.
 
Firstly, as you will know the player uses the Open Codec feature. This feature allows users to add external codecs to the media player. With the Open Codec feature supporting codecs that are compliant with the DirectShow filter standard. Some examples of these codecs that can be used with the Open Codec feature in the player include:

Finally, the codecs do change from time to time. If you are not sure which codec you need. Then use **MediaInfo Lite**and the**codec tweak tool**which will tell you what codec is needed for a video or audio file. Accordingly, then simply search this website for the codec or filter that is needed. There is no need to continually download the open codec pack for the Daum Potplayer. See also the **media player classic** for another player.
 
As part of a legal matter, I received a copy of a security video encoded using what appears to be an 'IMM5' codec, apparently often used by police. I also received a copy of 'BackupPlayer', which can play this video. Note that no media player I have installed, including VLC, is able to play it. IMM5 does not show up in the standard codec packs, and Google searches are surprisingly fruitless.
 
How about (and this is really the last option) using a desktop recorder tool (Fraps, VLC - yes, it can do that too.) and recording the video as it plays in that "BackupPlayer"? Since it's CCTV footage, it's probably low-resolution and framerate anyway, so you shouldn't have any noticable quality loss when doing that.
 
The article IMM4 Codec and MEncoder describes how the authorconverted IMM4 video to other formats, so my advice is to read it carefully.The codec was found to reside in VCMIMM4.dll, which would still probablyneed to be registered with regsvr32.
 
Run BackupPlayer setup.exe and install the IMM4 codec. Then download and play on Realplayer 16. That has a converter that allows you to convert for different devices. Works perfectly for me. Nicely converts to .m4v despite being IMM5 codec
 
You can download the codec form this side -camera-systems/security-and-surveillance-cameras-system-with-lcd-monitor/L23WD-Series-1-p#downloadsTabSelect: Codec - L23WD Series.When installed the codec you can open the file with potplayer and then by right click in the viewer window select video capturing, convert the file in a mkvRegards Martin

HEVC (aka H.265) has earned its reputation since 2014 when Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft announced HEVC support for their products in succession. From then on, the video codec is applied to a wide range of fields, incl. GoPro, iPhone, modern cameras, 4K/8K high-resolution videos, online streaming, 4K Blu-rays, and so on. However, Microsoft doesn't provide native support for the HEVC codec in Windows 11/10.
 
In this article, we will focus on how to free download HEVC codec extensions for 4K/8K video playback, and how to play HEVC videos without installing extra HEVC/H.265 codec packs, explaining what is HEVC codec, together with errors and FAQs about HEVC playback that users concern most.
 
**Summary:**You can open "ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9n4wgh0z6vhq" to download free HEVC Video Extensions from Device Manufacturer. But if this doesn't work, you can always buy and download the official HEVC extensions from the Microsoft Store. Meanwhile, there are various free HEVC codec packs and VLC to help open HEVC H.265 videos.
 
Codec packs make video playing easier by installing a number of different codecs at once. But they are likely to pose software conflict and are full of adware or spyware. That's exactly why Windows 10 introduces HEVC codec extensions officially. Microsoft charges for its official HEVC codec $0.99. Before you free download the HEVC video extensions and make a purchase, continue to read to make a well-informed decision.

Additionally, it is highly compatible, allowing for the seamless opening of HEVC videos on all Windows applications and smart TVs. Moreover, the installation process is straightforward, ensuring users can start using it without much hassle.
 
However, there are some notable drawbacks to consider.

This may be seen as a limitation for users who expect basic video format support to be included by default. Users may encounter occasional issues with Microsoft's HEVC video extensions. In cases where errors occur, troubleshooting can be challenging, and there is no option for a refund, potentially leaving users frustrated. It's worth noting that the HEVC codec demands specific hardware capabilities, such as an Intel 7th Generation Core processor and a newer GPU, in order to play HEVC videos in 4K and higher resolutions. This requirement may limit accessibility for users with older or less powerful systems.
