
 
Included in this program are fire guard test review questions and solutions; fire guard practice exams; and modules on fire guard job duties & responsibilities; building/home protection plans; understanding alarm systems & how to troubleshoot alarms.
 
The FDNY certification exams generally consist of 20 multiple-choice questions, which are presented on a touchscreen computer display. All Fireguard License exams have a time limit. Based on the number of questions, you will have a 30-minute time limit to complete the test. In order to receive a Certificate of Fitness, you must pass with a score of at least 70%.

An FDNY Certificate of Fitness is only valid for the person to whom it is issued and may be utilized anywhere throughout New York City. A $25 new application fee is required, and a $15 renewal fee for those already holding a Certificate of Fitness. Generally, applications are reviewed and processed within 1-2 days.
 
While gypsum boards are stronger in one direction, they may be installed either vertically or horizontally on both wood and steel studs. If the boards are to be used in a fire rated assembly, then use the board orientation that is stated in your specific rated assembly.
 
According to the Gypsum Association publication GA-231, gypsum board should not be allowed to get wet; it should be covered if stored outside. However, there are situations where the board could get wet during transportation/storage or when installed in-place. If the board gets wet in an installed in-place situation, first remove the sources of moisture. Lay the board on a flat surface and allow it to dry out thoroughly. Once the board is dry, examine it for paper-to-core bond and mold and mildew growth. If installed, examine for nail pops and sag (in the case of ceilings). Paper-to-core bond failure and board sag are irreversible damage, and the board should be replaced. For nail pops, place a fastener an inch above or below any popped-up nail.
 
There is not a fire rating on an individual board. The fire rating is based on an entire assembly (studs, board, fasteners, etc.) being tested together. Please consult the Gypsum Association GA-600 Fire Design Manual or UL Fire Resistance Directory for specifics on a particular fire-rated assembly. For additional information concerning fire ratings and fire safety, go to www.buildgp.com/safetyinfo.

Placement of control joints are determined by the design professional. When they are not designated, the requirement for ceilings and walls is the same. A control joint should be installed every 30 feet when there is not perimeter relief. When there is perimeter relief, control joints can be installed every 50 feet.
 
FireGuard is your complete source for Fire Extinguishers; Service, Inspections, Recharging, Hydrostatic Testing, and Training.
With FireGuard, you get Factory Trained and Certified Fire Extinguisher Technicians. Our expert technicians know and understand the local Omaha Fire Codes to ensure your business is Fire Code compliant.
 
Depending on what type of portable fire extinguisher you have, a 12 year or 5 year hydrostatic test shall be performed (per fire code). FireGuard is a DOT certified Cylinder Retesting Facility, offering FAST turn around options! Here is the procedure for the hydrostatic test for the fire extinguisher:
 
FireGuard offers a wide range of fire safety products and services, including fire extinguishers, fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, restaurant systems, special hazard systems and exit/emergency lighting systems.
 
**F01 Citywide Fire Guard for Impairment.** This certification relates to buildings whose fire protection systems are out of service. Building owners are required to have a watch guard with F01 certification on duty until the system is back up.
 
To help our students pass the test the first time, Star Security Training offers 3-hour test prep courses for the major certifications mentioned above. Course fee is $50 and includes a printed FDNY study guide. Click here for more details on our fire guard test prep schedule.
 
Flame Guard Liquid is a revolutionaly fire retardant additive that mixes with most acrylic latex coatings to create a Class A flame retardant paint film on interior surfaces of non-flammable substrates. Flame Guard Liquid is designed to slow the flame spread on a treated surface when added to the coating. Apply two coats with brush roller or sprayer. Tested with satin and eggshell coatings.
 
**TESTING INFORMATION:** Flame Guard Liquid has been tested in accordance with ASTM E-84 Standard Method of Testing for Surface Burning Characteristic of Building Materials and Canada's ULC S102 to test materials that will be installed on walls and ceilings.
 
Flame Guard Liquid has been tested on cement gypsum/non-flammable substrate and southern yellow pine. It meets the Both UL 723, NFPA 255 and UBC 42-1 - Class A rating over non-flammable substratre and Class C rating over southern yellow pine.
 
Flame Guard Liquid has been tested on cement gypsum/non-flammable substrate and southern yellow pine. It meets the Both UL 723, NFPA 255 and UBC 42-1: Class A and Class C. Class A rating over non-flammable substratre and Class C rating over southern yellow pine.

We constantly test the Liquid Flame Guard on different substrates based on our customers' needs, from gypsum to plywood to OSB and non-flammable substrates. Our goal is to provide products our customers need.
 
For example, one of the tests completed was over a non-flammable substrate. While it might seem unnecessary because the substrate is non-flammable, it is one of the #1 requests we have received from customers due to specific building codes.
 
The ASTM E-84 test method is a 10-minute fire test response standard intended to provide comparative measurements of the surface burning behavior of building materials to exposed surfaces. It tests for flame spread and smoke density measurements of select substrates under specific fire exposure conditions.
 
ASTM E84 testing produces two index values, the Flame Spread Index (FSI) and the Smoke Developed Index (SDI), used by code officials, fire marshalls, designer companies, and architects to determine whether a product is suitable for its intended application.
 
Fireguard tanks are thermally protected double-wall steel cylindrical or rectangular aboveground tanks. Each Fireguard that Highland Tank builds is UL labeled and meet or exceed the requirements of UL-2085 including: a two-hour full scale pool fire test, a hose stream test, a ballistics/projectile test, a vehicle impact test, and an interstitial communication test.

 
According to the US EPA and an EPA memo regarding use of alternative secondary containment measures, a double-wall tank will provide secondary containment when certain equipment is installed. Local Firecode will also have requirements for Secondary Containment Type Aboveground Tanks that also need to be followed.
 
STI/SPFA licensed FIREGUARD tank passed the Standing Loss Control portion of the new CARB EVR (enhanced vapor recovery) certification requirement on October 3, 2008. The CARB issued an Executive Order for new installations and an Executive Order for existing installations.
 
Each local jurisdiction has its own fire code requirements. However, most jurisdictions reference one of the Model Fire Codes. Charts showing the set-back requirements for aboveground tanks used for motor vehicle dispensing per the most recent fire codes revision cycle are available.
 
A UL Certificate of Compliance was issued in 1998 and a UL Certificate of Compliance was issued in 2007. The 1998 Certificate refers to the fire codes at that time; the 2007 certificate references the updated fire codes. In addition, STI/SPFA has provided an explanation of the performance tests required by UL 2085.
 
When NFPA first developed a definition for a fire resistant tank, they believed that at the end of the test, the tank simply needed to serve its basic function. They felt it was critical that the tank continued holding its product, that the supports continued to support the tank and that the emergency vent continued to operate. To meet this criterion it was not necessary for the interior of the tank to remain below a specified temperature. UFC took a much different approach which is what the Fireguard tank is based on. UL 2080 was developed by UL alone based on their own criteria.
 
During the furnace test performed by UL at their facility for the Performance Testing required by UL 2085 for Protected Tanks, the test duration was extended from 2 hours to 4 hours. UL provided a letter regarding this testing. See this letter from UL regarding this testing. Please note this data re
