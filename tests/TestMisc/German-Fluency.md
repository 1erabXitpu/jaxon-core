But I would say I am not able to lead a complex conversation and definitely not able to do a long presentation in german to someone, as it surpasses my current language capacity. I never hid my limited german capacity during the interviews either, they only cared that I could speak decent german. I want to ask a few questions:
 
1. It should not play a major role since even in Germany, the project language for most engagement is English. On top of that, if you work with German teams, your client-level German will develop very rapidly (within 1-2 projects) if you are already at the level you are talking about.

2. Definitely. You will quickly pick up the level needed. Apart from that, showcase your willingness to learn + your excellent analytics and leadership abilities. You should be fine :-) I know a couple of non-natives from McK Germany who did very, very well.
 
3. I have heard of some cases (skill-building, not necessarily language-related). 

Bonus tip: If you are at McKinsey with global staffing, try to get an engagement outside of Germany if you feel more comfortable.
 
1 - No, but it really **depends on the client and the industry.** There are some very traditional industries where clients don't even want any English business terms and all in German written and verbally. The projects will be mainly German-speaking but in many DAX companies, English is also spoken a lot and people are more open-minded.
 
2 - Yes, definitely. You might just need to practice and work a bit harder to make sure you are **well prepared for presentations**etc. Some mistakes here and there are completely fine, as long as it is easy to understand you. However, you will get probably the **feedback** to improve your German and there will be the **expectation that you will learn fast.**
 
3 - I didn't hear about language courses per se but there are a lot of **courses on all types of communication** which might help you, too. It certainly doesn't hurt to ask as firms offer individual **budgets for self-development.**
 
When at Bain, I worked in Spain but I am not a native Spanish speaker. My spanish was enough to hold a conversation, but I clearly had limitations.

I still worked with Spanish clients, but those with more international environments/team, meaning that many of the meetings were held in English (but not all) and the presentations were also prepared in English. Of course, some meetings wer still in Spanish. I usually wouldn't be alone there.

And they would offer weekly Spanish classes with an individual tutor.

I would bet you will have a similar experience - being assigned to projects where german will be less of an issue, and getting support in improving your language skills.
 
**1 - Would that cause me any problems in the future or limit my chances to be staffed here locally? I am working A LOT on my german currently, but it takes time to get it to the upper level.**

The main problem will be with networking (both with colleagues and clients). Even if you are fine during the job, you will have fewer opportunities to connect with the team / client compared to local candidates. It may not be a big issue at the beginning but long term this could limit your ability to grow unless you become fluent.
 
I first applied in Germany but couldn't go ahead as my German is not C1 level. **Unless you are an expert hire, meaning you are not bound to the region/country to work, you are expected to have at least C1 local language knowledge to work with local clients, as local projects are done in 90% in the local language, not English.**

Founded in 1915 as the first of the Language Schools, the German School has decades of experience in helping students achieve true fluency in German language and culture, whether they are undergraduates, graduate students, professionals, or life-long learners of all ages.
 
In the film "The Imitation Game" Alan Turing, while being interviewed at Bletchley Park, confesses that he doesn't speak German, which almost makes him fail the interview. I think I read somewhere else (Simon Singh?) that breaking Enigma was one of the earliest examples when cryptoanalysis required more math than language knowledge, so this scene might emphasize that fact.
 
However, I find it hard to believe that Turing didn't know German at all. For example, in his earlier work on Entscheidungsproblem, Turing refers to Gdel's papers, which were not translated to English until 1960s (quoting C. Petzold).
 
Update: when I was asking this question, this was the only scene of the film I had seen (in a trailer). Now that I have seen the whole movie, I realize how stupid the question was. I mean, that was likely the least of all the inaccuracies.
 
By the time he was at university, Alan Turing had sufficient facility at reading German (in gothic type no less) that he was reading advanced texts on Quantum Mechanics. In chapter 4 of the biography "Prof: Alan Turing Decoded" in the section The domination of the Germans, Sir Dermot Turing notes
 
One of the prize books awarded to Alan by Sherborne was Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik (Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics) by John von Neumann, whom we will encounter again. [...] Alan reported that von Neumann was 'very interesting reading, although the applied mathematicians seem to find it rather strong meat'.
 
It was strong meat because it was in German, a language in which Alan had demonstrated his lack of aptitude for languages at Sherborne; but if you were serious about maths in the 1930s, you had to be able to get on with mathematical German.
 
I'm also told by classified historians that the tri-partite liaison meetings between the British, French and Polish cryptanalysts on Enigma (at some of which, Turing was present) were conducted in German as it was the common language that all of the cryptanalysts knew. This is confirmed in part by chapter 6 of Herivelismus by John Herivel.
 
Post-war there is an elusive story that Turing was part of a group that visited Germany to understand Konrad Zuse's progress in developing a computer. Accounts say that the "interrogation" took the form of a colloquium.
 
It's known that Turing could occasionally stutter, which might have limited his ability to demonstrate fluency in a secondary school classroom, but it is clear that his command of written German was very strong indeed.
 
I suspect that Alun Turing had to read Published materials during his Academic career and prior to Bletchley by Authors most probably from German descent, some of which may not have been translated? If I had to guess, I would have thought Alun Turning may have been self educated in this regard, due to the nature of the area of Science and Mathematics fields he was learning at the time, this means there were other Mathematicians & scientists who recorded their works in their own languages, prior to those materials leaving academia and translated into English journals, which I guess would safely mean one would need to learn about, even if not in his native Language. This is all just antidotal, yet again another example is probably whilst in his famous role at Bletchley park working on the UTM I suspect due to the sheer amount of Foreign (German) intercepted communications received at the time which required deciphering and of the importance language was to understanding how to break a communication encryption device "Enigma" how could one not help but to pick up bits of the language here and there?, even in an unorthodox fashion, which over time, Alun Turing accumulated into a good understanding of the German Language. If this is not enough reasoning to allow for safe assumptions, outlined above as to the question:"is there any evidence about Turing's knowledge of German?"I would state Yes, almost certainly, Alun Turing learned German during his Efforts, maybe even prior to Bletchley Park. I would also assume Alun Turing would have been asked to take German lessons by his Superiors / Commanding Officer in an Official Capacity and like with all Signal Intelligence you learn from AND about your operating environment. These is all probable events which are safe to assume probably occurred. For a definitive answer I suspect the National Archive may hold the key as to the true answer inside either Alun Turnings War Records or even in Princeton University may hold some works or information about his background incl spoken languages Alun Turning was Fluent in.
 
In this post, I'll walk you through each of the steps you need to achieve fluency in German one by one. You'll get insider knowledge from my years of expertise teaching hundreds of people to speak this very expressive language.
 
Most people want to improve their conversational skills to a point where they can have a solid conversation with a native speaker. Conversational fluency is the ability to do this - to communicate on everyday topics without struggling for every word. You don't need a native-level of fluency (unless of course you're training to be an undercover international spy).
 
They're based on classroom learning, which frequently relies on ineffective passive approaches, such as lectures. In my years of teaching students, I've discovered that active speaking helps you to remember far more vocabulary than passive listening, and language acquisition research supports this.
