I finally have the vector games working that stopped when I upgraded to Windows 7 from xp, and have found a site (emuparadise)to get roms that so far seem to be working. Some still don't work, (Dig Dug, Galaga and Major Havoc, for three examples. I downloaded every possible file, no versions work) and I am wondering if the the MAMEBIOS file that one of the first few rom pages said I needed to download to make that rom work is why some still don't work.
 
According to the main MAMEdev page I need to "leave the bios file zipped and put it in the roms folder." Ok. It is called MAMEBIOS in my downloads folder. Is it that simple or do I need one specific to the version of MAME that I am using? There didn't seem to be any choices. If it specific to versions, how would I find the one I need to go with MAME UI64 0.172 which was the latest version, when I gave up (for a while) trying to get the vector games working again, and the others 60 or so that stopped working when forced to switch from xp to Windows 7.

Things are working pretty good so far, so I'd like to know what this file will do or if I even have the right one before I put it in with the roms and audit the games to maybe find out I have the wrong file and now a boatload of games don't work again.
 
Your MAMEBIOS file might be a zip that contains more zips of individual machine bios sets. If that is the case you would put the individual bios zip files, extracted from the large one, in your roms folder.
 
Is CVS a BIOS rom? I have a cvs.zip file in my rom directory but according to the MAWS website there is no such rom, BIOS or otherwise. Yet a search for CVS returns 3 roms that seem to require the CVS BIOS rom (diggerc, herbiedk, spacefrt). In CLRMamePro, the results show that cvs.zip is incorrectly named and should be huncholy.zip. Can somebody please confirm whether cvs.zip is a BIOS rom or should be renamed as huncholy.zip? :unsure
 
It should be the bios rom for the Century Electronics CVS board, a lot of games use it in maws search for CVS click one of the games then click CVS.C and a whole list of games appear (ignore all the convertions...).
 
Looking at it though it would seem they removed the CVS bios entry a few revisions ago, but as the games still need the CVS bios you must copy the 5b.bin, 82s185.10h and the 82s123.10k files from the CVS bios into the games .zip file or they won't work.

Is there a way to do this on MAME OS X? There's no option in the preferences window, and if you enter the settings of the emulator (F2) you can change some of the settings of the game but not enable console mode.
 
I've also read that it has to do with the BIOS it's running. I donwloaded a neogeo.zip (without it games don't even run)... but I don't know how to force MAME OS X to run a particular bios either (I've read that unibios makes the trick but I'm clueless about how to make it work).
 
Depending on the command you're using the pattern with, pattern matching maymatch systems or systems and devices. It is advised to put quotes around yourpatterns to avoid having your shell try to expand them against filenames (e.g.**mame -validate "pac\*"**).
 
Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. If youstart MAME by double-clicking it in Windows Explorer, the working directory isset to the folder containing the MAME executable. If you start MAME bydouble-clicking it in the macOS Finder, it will open a Terminal window with theworking directory is set to your home directory (usually /Users/ )and start MAME.
 
If you want behaviour similar to what Windows Explorer provides on macOS, createa script file containing these lines in the directory containing the MAMEexecutable (for example you could call it mame-here ):
 
You should be able to use any text editor. If you have a choice of file formator line ending style, choose UNIX. This assumes you're using a 64-bit releasebuild of MAME, but if you aren't you just need to change mame to the nameof your MAME executable (e.g. mamed, mamep, mamedp). Once you've created thefile, you need to mark it as executable. You can do this by opening a Terminalwindow, typing **chmod a+x** followed by a space, dragging the file you createdonto the window (this causes Terminal to insert the full escaped path to thefile), and then ensuring the Terminal window is active and hitting **Return**(or **Enter**) on your keyboard. You can close the Terminal window after doingthis. Now if you double-click the script in the Finder, it will open aTerminal window, set the working directory to the location of the script(i.e. the folder containing MAME), and then start MAME.
 
If a pattern is specified, it will validate systems matching the pattern,otherwise it will validate all systems and devices. Note that if a patternis specified, it will be matched against systems only (not other devices),and no device type validation will be performed.
 
Note: By default, all the '**-list**' verbs below write info to the standardoutput (usually the terminal/command window where you typed the command). Ifyou wish to write the info to a text file instead, add this to the end of yourcommand:
 
This creates (or overwrites the existing file if already there) list.txtand fills the file with the results of **-listcrc puckman**. In otherwords, the list of each ROM used in Puckman and the CRC for that ROM arewritten into that file.
 
List comprehensive details for all of the supported systems and devices inXML format. The output is quite long, so it is usually better to redirectthis into a file. By default all systems are listed; however, you can limitthis list by specifying one or more patterns after the **-listxml** verb.
 
Output from this command is typically more useful if redirected toan output file. For instance, doing**mame -listxml galaxian > galax.xml** will make galax.xml oroverwrite any existing data in the file with the results of**-listxml**; this will allow you to view it in a text editor or parseit with external tools.
 
Displays a list of system driver names and descriptions. By default allsystems and devices are listed; however, you can limit this list byspecifying one or more patterns after the **-listfull** verb.
 
Displays a list of system drivers/devices and the names of the source fileswhere they are defined. Useful for finding which driver a system runs on inorder to fix bugs. By default all systems and devices are listed; however,you can limit this list by specifying one or more pattern after the**-listsource** verb.
 
Displays a list of clones. By default all clones are listed; however, youcan limit this list by specifying a pattern after the **-listsource**verb. If a pattern is specified, MAME will list clones of systems thatmatch the pattern, as well as clones that match the pattern themselves.
 
Displays a full list of CRCs and names of all ROM images referenced bysystems and devices matching the specified pattern(s). If no patterns arespecified, ROMs referenced by all supported systems and devices will beincluded.
 
Checks for invalid or missing ROM images. By default all drivers that havevalid ZIP files or directories in the rompath are verified; however, you canlimit this list by specifying a pattern after the **-verifyroms** command.
 
Checks for invalid or missing samples. By default all drivers that havevalid ZIP files or directories in the samplepath are verified; however, youcan limit this list by specifying a pattern after the **-verifyroms**command.
 
Attempts to identify ROM files, if they are known to MAME, in the specified.zip file or directory. This command can be used to try and identify ROMsets taken from unknown boards. On exit, the errorlevel is returned as oneof the following:
 
Displays a list of all devices known to be hooked up to a system. The ":" isconsidered the system itself with the devices list being attached to givethe user a better understanding of what the emulation is using.
 
If slots are populated with devices, any additional slots those devicesprovide will be visible with **-listdevices** as well. For instance,installing a floppy controller into a PC will expose the disk drive slots.
 
If slots are populated with devices, any additional slots those devicesprovide will be visible with **-listslots** as well. For instance,installing a floppy controller into a PC will expose the disk drive slots.
 
Checks for invalid or missing ROM images in your software lists. By defaultall drivers that have valid ZIP files or directories in the rompath areverified; however, you can limit this list by specifying a specific drivername or pattern after the **-verifysoftware** command.
 
Checks a specified software list for missing ROM images if files exist forissued softwarelistname. By default, all drivers that have valid ZIP filesor directories in the rompath are verified; however, you can limit this listby specifying a specific softwarelistname (without .XML) after the-verifysoftlist command.
 
Key used to enable/disable MAME keyboard controls when the emulated systemhas keyboard inputs. The default setting is **Forward Delete** on macOS or**SCRLOCK** on other operating systems (including Windows and Linux). Use**FN-Delete** on Macintosh computers with notebook/compact keyboards.
 
Path to a text file containing game controller button and axis mappings inthe format used by SDL2 and Steam, or none to use only built-inmappings. Must use an ASCII-compatible text encoding with native lineendings (e.g. CRLF on Windows). Currently only supported when using thesdlgame joystick provider. The default setting is none.
